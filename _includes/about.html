              <p>
                I’m a mechatronics engineer and robotics student, currently pursuing a Master’s in Robotics. I like building
                systems that connect perception to action, from computer vision pipelines to motion planning and real robot
                execution.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m especially interested in robot manipulation, motion planning, and multi-robot systems (swarm-style
                coordination and distributed autonomy). I enjoy turning messy real-world problems into robust, testable
                software that runs on hardware.

              <p>
                I’m actively looking for robotics software roles and internships involving ROS 2, perception, planning,
                simulation, and embedded or real-time systems. I’m happiest on teams shipping tools that make robots more
                reliable in the real world.
