        <p>
          I’m a mechatronics engineer and robotics student, currently pursuing a Master’s in Robotics. I like building
          systems that connect perception to action, from computer vision pipelines to motion planning and real robot
          execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m especially interested in robot manipulation, motion planning, and multi-robot systems (swarm-style
          coordination and distributed autonomy). I enjoy turning messy real-world problems into robust, testable
          software that runs on hardware.

          I’m actively looking for robotics software roles and internships involving ROS 2, perception, planning,
          simulation, and embedded or real-time systems. I’m happiest on teams shipping tools that make robots more
          reliable in the real world.
